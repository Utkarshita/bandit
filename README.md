# Bandit Wargame â€“ OverTheWire

This repository contains my notes and solutions for the Bandit wargame hosted on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

## What is Bandit?

Bandit is a beginner-level wargame designed to teach the basics of Linux, the command line, file operations, and security concepts.  
Each level involves connecting to a server over SSH and solving a puzzle to retrieve the password for the next level.

## Repo Structure

Each level is documented in its own Markdown file:

Every file includes:
- The objective of the level  
- Commands used  
- Short explanations  
- Terminal output (where needed)

## Tools & Topics Covered

- Basic Linux commands (`cat`, `ls`, `cd`, `find`, `grep`, `sort`, etc.)
- SSH and file permissions
- Hidden files and symbolic names
- Compression formats (`gz`, `bz2`, `tar`, etc.)
- Encoding and decoding (`base64`, `rot13`)
- Scripting and cron jobs
- Simple networking using `nc` and `openssl`
  

This repo is for learning, practicing, and tracking my progress through the game. Will keep updating it as I complete more levels.
